# LL

* Solution 1. Single LL implementation add basic function
* Solution 2. Finding middle element in a linked list
* Solution 3. Reverse a linked list
* Solution 4. Rotate a Linked List after k
* Solution 5. Detect Loop in linked list
* Solution 6. Fix Loop in linked list
* Solution 7. Reverse a Linked List in groups of given size
* Solution 8. Doubly LL implementation add basic function
* Solution 9. LRU Cache (to do)
* Solution 10. Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. (to do - brute-force)
* Solution 11. Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.
* Solution 12. Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
* Solution 13. You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked
list.
* Solution 14. Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop
* Solution 15. clone list (to-do)
* Solution 16. 
* Solution 17.
