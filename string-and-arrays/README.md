# String And Arrays

* Solution 1. Reverse a string
* Solution 2. Reverse a string without affecting special characters (to do)
* Solution 3. Find the Missing Number
* Solution 4. Contigous sub array sum
* Solution 5. Continuous subarray with given sum (to do)
* Solution 6. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
* Solution 7. Equilibrium point
* Solution 8.zig-zag array (need better)
* Solution 9. Parenthesis Checker (to do)
* Solution 10. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
* Solution 11. Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
* Solution 12. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’
* Solution 13. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? (to-do)
* Solution 14. Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.
* Solution 15. Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).
